## Collaborations
#### This is a hand-on cloud engineering project delivered by the azubi africa cloud team in 2023. After 6 months of AWS cloud training and front-end development, we got a chance to work on some realife cloud projects. It focuses on working with dynamo dB, docker, composer, AWS ECS, Fargate and other AWS Services. I was able to work with:

## About The Project
## The project have four major tasks which are:
The App should now have the ability to add new records, send notifications on app activity and also view data from the DynamoDB. Explore the Deliverables Menu option to derive insights on the details required.

```
1. Add new users: Using forms, collect user data. e.g full name, age, occupation, nationality, marital-status, and email address, and store them in the DynamoDB table. 
2. Add notification: An email confirmation displaying a message, such as "Thank you for filling out the form. Welcome to the Gold Grid family." 
3. A dashboard : display real-time data such as:
- users logged onto the app
- Number of users
- Timestamp of logging onto  the app
- Nationality counts
```
